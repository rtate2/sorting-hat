# Sorting Hat

## Description
<!-- the description will get bigger as the projects get bigger -->
Use this application to sort profiles of students to a random house (Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, or Slytherin).  You should also be able to expel a student after they have been sorted, which should remove their card from the student record.
